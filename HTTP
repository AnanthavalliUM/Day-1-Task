HTTP 1.1:  

  The first version of HTTP  was created in 1997.
  HTTP /1.1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
  HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
  HTTP/1.1 allows a server to serves the content to a client device if the client asks for it .

                
HTTP 2:

 HTTP/2 was introduced in 2015.
 HTTP/2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object: 

    Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects differ from primitive data types (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
    Primitive data types contain only one value, but Objects can hold many values in the form of Key: value pair. 
    These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Syntax:

     The syntax to describe a object is
 
       var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};

Let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :

let institution = {
Name : " Guvi geek network private limited ",
Location : " Chennai ",
Courses : " Full stack” , “Data science”, “Cyber security ",
Languages : " English” , “Tamil”,” Telugu”, “Malayalam”,” Hindi ";
}


In the above example 
"name", "location", "courses", & "languages" are all “keys” and " Guvi geek network private limited ", " Chennai "," full stack , data science, cyber security ," English Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi "are values of these keys respectively. Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object.
